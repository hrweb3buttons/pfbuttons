    <h2>What this was</h2>
    <p>
      Hunter's Toolbox started in June 2025 as a single tool: A token importer built
      quietly, without being asked, for a small group of people I cared about. The support
      team for the Pool Funding community had been walking new members through a tedious manual process
      during every onboarding. I saw the problem. I had the skills to fix it. So I fixed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shared it with a handful of people I trusted. It spread on its own from there.
      Eventually I made it official, because the community had already found it — and what
      had started as a widget on a Blogspot sidebar had become something worth giving a
      proper home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the course of a year, it grew into something I never planned and am genuinely
      proud of. A wallet approval scanner that checked permissions against live threat
      databases. An RPC switcher that saw members through real outages when their wallets
      stopped working. A portfolio tracker, a token calculator, swap shortcuts, real-time
      charts, mobile fallbacks, community guides, and weekly calls — all of it built
      independently, maintained carefully, and given freely.
    </p>
    <div class="callout">
      I thought of it as a love letter to this community. That is still how I think of it,
      even now.
    </div>
    <p>
      The tools worked. That part was never in question.

    <h2>What happened</h2>
    <p>
      From early in the Toolbox's life, it was clear that sustainability would be a
      challenge. The tools were free. The infrastructure was volunteer. The maintenance
      was entirely mine. I raised the question of sustainability through every channel
      available to me, over many months, before anything changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Donation buttons on the page itself. Regular community updates. Weekly Zoom calls,
      including multiple sessions where I addressed the sustainability issue directly and
      walked the community through what happens when free infrastructure goes unsupported.
      A 22 post long Public Goods Campaign across Telegram. Individual sponsorship
      listings on the community marketplace. A formal sustainability statement. A
      dedicated history page. A series of escalating notices on this page, each one
      clearer than the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      The target was $150 per month. Thus was enough to move off free hosting, run a private
      RPC node, maintain the Zoom license for community calls, and build toward the
      features that members had been asking for. Spread across the active membership
      of this community, a very small amount per person.
    </p>
    <p>
      One person responded. A single member of this community, publicly and of her own
      volition, committed $10 per month and said she found the Toolbox essential to the
      project. She later added more when the shutdown was announced. Her support, and
      her words, meant more than she probably knows.
    </p>
    <div class="callout warning">
      Beyond that single act of support, the financial response to everything above was
      $0. The Toolbox ran for one year on nothing but my time, my labor, and my belief
      that this community was worth it. Eventually, that belief ran out of things to
      sustain it.
    </div>
    <p>
      There is no villain in this story. No one set out to exploit what was built here,
      or to harm the person who built it. What happened was quieter and more ordinary
      than that: A community that meant well, consumed something freely, and simply
      never connected appreciation with responsibility. That is perhaps the most honest
      and most painful version of this ending.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not a complicated story. A community consumed something freely without
      contributing to its survival. The person who built it could not continue indefinitely.
      The tools went offline. This is how it ends for most things like this.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Warning -->
  <div class="card">
    <h2>For anyone who comes after</h2>
    <p>
      If you are a builder — someone with skills, with care, with the instinct to see a
      problem and fix it — and you are considering giving those skills freely to a community
      like this one, read this page before you begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      What happened here is not unique. It is one of the most documented patterns in
      open source software and Web3. A person builds something real. The community adopts
      it enthusiastically. The tool becomes infrastructure — invisible, assumed, taken for
      granted. The person maintaining it continues to invest, alone and unsupported, until
      they cannot justify continuing. Then it disappears, and the community discovers too
      late what they had.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew this pattern before I started. I had seen it many times. I hoped this
      community would be different. It was not.
    </p>
    <div class="callout">
      Build if you must. The instinct to build is not wrong. But structure your work so
      that its survival does not depend entirely on the goodwill of the people consuming
      it. Decide in advance what you need in return, state it clearly from the beginning,
      and be willing to enforce it. Do not wait until you have already given everything
      before making the ask. By then, the anchor of free is set, and almost nothing
      moves it.
    </div>
    <p>
      The tragedy of the commons is real. The free rider problem is real. The diffusion
      of responsibility is real. These are not abstract concepts. They are what this
      page is.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope you fare better than I did. I hope the community you find is worthy of what
      you bring to it. And if it isn't — I hope you find the clarity to walk away sooner
      than I did, and with less of yourself left behind.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>A final word</h2>
    <p>
      The nearly five hundred people helped personally. The outages navigated. The
      onboardings that went smoothly because the token importer was there. The wallets
      that were a little safer because the approval scanner ran. The members who found
      their RPC switcher when nothing else worked.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was real. All of it. Whatever the community did or did not do with the
      opportunity to sustain it, the year of work was real, and it mattered to real people
      in real moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am grateful for that. I am grateful for the one person who showed up. I am grateful
      for the members of the support team who understood what this was and what it cost.
      I am grateful for every person who used these tools and found them useful, even if
      they never said so.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lighthouse has gone dark. The ships that needed it have passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever comes next, I am still a builder. That did not end here.
    </p>
